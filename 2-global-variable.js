// In vanilla javascript, we have window object.
// From window, we can find bunch of useful thing. Ex: query selector. 
// But, in node,there is no window. Why? Because there is no Browser.

// Globals - No Window

// Some Global Variable are :
// __dirname - path to current directory
// __filname - file name
// require - function to use module(file)
// process - info about env where the program is being executed

console.log(__dirname)
console.log(__filename)
